PlanGrid Coding Challenge

Build a rock paper scissors game.

The goal of this assignment is to showcase your skills writing efficient,
testable, and maintainable code. You can use any language you'd like. This
should not take you longer than two hours. It must include tests and
instructions on how to run locally.

Once complete, push to a public git repo and send the link to redacted.

Minimum Gameplay Requirements:

This is a two player game. The game prompts a user for a move (rock, paper,
scissors), then prompts the other user for their move. It should then output
who won. Ties should be communicated as such. The game should read user input
and display results in a CLI.

*Unit tests are required, as is a README file with instructions on how to run
the game and tests.

Implementing some Additional Features are highly recommended.

Additional Features:
Anything you think will make the game more fun! Some possibilities might be:

- Persisting user data between games
- An AI opponent
- Making the game a web app
- Support players on different machines
